## Project Overview
Developed an innovative blockchain-based platform that verifies and authenticates resume details using NFTs to combat fraudulent claims and enhance the integrity of the recruitment process.

## Key Features
- Utilized Ethereum blockchain and NFT-based intelligent contracts using Solidity to facilitate reliable information exchange between institutions and users.
- Integrated a Flask server and web3 API for swift authentication of supplied tokens, enhancing resume authenticity and ATS ranking.
- Maintained a list of NFT-compliant companies/institutes to ensure users weren't penalized for lacking permits.
- Planned future iterations to employ robust encryption algorithms like SHA-2 for enhanced security.

## Technical Stack
Backend: Flask, Gunicorn
Frontend: React.js
Deployment: Apache2 on a self-hosted container, GitHub Runner on Ubuntu OS
Blockchain: Ethereum, Ganache, Truffle Suite, Solidity, Remix IDE
Other Tools: ExifTool (for embedding metadata), mockaroo, tonic.ai

## Challenges & Learnings
Overcame challenges related to Ethereum testnets, SPA page refreshing rules, and proxy pass configurations.
Gained hands-on experience with blockchain concepts, NFTs, and various frameworks.
Explored multiple tools and APIs, including the llama model, ChatGPT API, and Affinda API.

## Achievements

Winner of the Descope Challenge #2 at DeveloperWeek CloudX 2023 Hackathon.
Successfully brainstormed and implemented a real-world use case backed by web3.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
